    <div id="story"> <h2 style="font-size: 45px;color: ghostwhite;"> Story Of LOL Studio Productions</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;color: ghostwhite;">This is the story of LOL Studio Productions.
        I was doing some language homework when I got confused with a question. So I used google translate. It was a fill in the blank. The "blank" was a underscore. So I translated it and whenever the underscore came it said "Adigere".It was very funny to me .Soon after there was a school Talent show. And I wanted to make a funny video. So I thought Why Not Combine It Together? Yes , This started out as a joke which was an act for school talent show. And when I showed it to my classmates they were laughing and demanding for a part 2!.So later I made a part 2 and soon a part 3. My classmates wanted to get the videos so I made this website. I needed a replacement for the name "Adigere" So I put "Made By LOL Studio Productions" In my part 2 just as a joke. Now It's a public website. Thatâ€™s about it for the beginning of LOL Studio Productions. Copyright- Suggested by SME
